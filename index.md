## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.png">

Hello! I am a Cyber Security Intern @ Idaho National Laboratoy (INL) who recently graduated from Dakota State University. If you don't know me well, my main interests are malware analysis, reverse engineering, and - broadly - cars (e.g. my [2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara XSport](suzuki.jpg)).

I have an orange tabby named, [Clover](clover.jpg). The #1 love of my life 🐱.
